## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes using a Makefile. You will perform linting, formatting, refactoring, and testing on a Python script to ensure its quality and functionality.

## Goals

By the end of this lab, you will:

1. Understand the importance of CI/CD processes in MLOps.
2. Learn how to use a Makefile for automating linting, formatting, refactoring, and testing.


### Lab Tasks

Run the following steps of the Makefile:
   - `make lint`
   - `make format`
   - `make refactor`
   - `make test`
